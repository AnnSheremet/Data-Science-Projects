|[Apartment sales-Real estate market analysis][1] | The influence of the area, ceilings, number of rooms, the date of the announcement on the prices of apartments in all the presented settlements and the center of St. Petersburg was revealed to build an automated price determination system to avoid fraud and anomalies. Based on the Yandex.Realty service data, the market value of various types of real estate objects, typical parameters of apartments, depending on the distance from the center, were determined. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, data preprocessing, math |
|[Car price prediction][2] | A used car service is developing an app to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. Analyzed data: technical characteristics, equipment and prices of cars. A model was built to determine the cost of a used car. Numerical methods, approximate calculations, algorithm complexity estimation, gradient descent are used. | Pandas, sklearn, numpy, LightGBM, machine learning, CatBoost |
| [Forecasting taxi orders][3] | Analyzed historical data on taxi orders at airports. Predicted the number of taxi orders for the next hour to attract more drivers during peak periods. A model was built for such a prediction. | Pandas, sklearn, numpy, LightGBM,l Matplotlib, StatsModels, CatBoost, machine learning |
| [Outflow of bank customers][4] | Customers began to leave the bank every month. The probability of the client leaving the bank in the near future is predicted. A model with an extremely large value of the F1-score was constructed with subsequent verification on a test sample. Additionally measured AUC-ROC, correlated with F1-score. Supervised learning. Dealing with unbalanced data. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, math, numpy, sklearn, machine learning |
| [Preparation of a prototype model for a metalworking enterprise][5] | The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of the gold mining industry. A model has been built to predict the recovery factor of gold from gold-bearing ore. Analyzed data with parameters of extraction and purification. A model has been built and trained to help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, math, numpy, sklearn, machine learning |
| [Research on the reliability of borrowers][6] | Input data from the credit department of the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers. Cleaned up data from outliers, gaps and duplicates, as well as converted different data formats. Replaced data types with those corresponding to the stored data. Removed duplicates. The lemmas in the column values are highlighted and the data is categorized. The share of creditworthy clients has been determined. The influence of the marital status and the number of children of the client on the fact of repaying the loan on time is analyzed. A credit scoring model has been built - a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank. | data preprocessing, Python, Pandas, PyMystem3, lemmatization, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciKitLearn, numpy |
